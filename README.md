# item-shop

# How does it work?
You change the items in shop.json by their id and give them a price as number,
 
If you want to add more items just add another object.

If you want to remove one do the the other way.


# When does my shop get in-game (if pulled)?
The Item-Shop in-game gets updated at 2 AM (CET / CEST)

# This might help you.
